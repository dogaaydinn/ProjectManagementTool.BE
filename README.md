# Project Management Tool - Backend üöÄ

This repository contains the backend implementation of the **Project Management Tool**, a platform designed to streamline project planning, task assignments, and collaboration. Built with **.NET Core**, this backend provides robust APIs, secure authentication, and data management features to support the frontend application or other client integrations.

## Technology Stack
- **.NET Core**
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**
- **ASP.NET Core**
 - **MySQL**

## Features ‚ú®

- **Project and Task Management:**  
  - Create, update, and delete projects and tasks.  
  - Assign tasks to team members with deadlines and priorities.

- **User Authentication and Authorization:**  
  - Secure user registration and login using JWT-based authentication.  
  - Role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Manager, User).

- **API Design:**  
  - RESTful APIs for seamless integration with frontend applications or external tools.  
  - Clear and consistent endpoint structure.

- **Error Handling and Validation:**  
  - Comprehensive input validation.  
  - Custom error responses for a better developer experience.

- **Database Integration:**  
  - Uses **Entity Framework Core** for data persistence.  
  - Support for SQL-based relational databases.

## Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

The project is organized into a multi-layered architecture for scalability and maintainability:

1. **Controllers**  
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses.  
   - Defines endpoints for user, project, and task management.

2. **Services**  
   - Contains the business logic of the application.  
   - Processes input data and interacts with repositories.

3. **Repositories**  
   - Manages database operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
   - Abstracts data persistence logic.

4. **Models**  
   - Represents entities like `User`, `Project`, and `Task`.  
   - Includes data annotations for validation.

5. **Utilities**  
   - Helper functions for tasks like JWT generation, password hashing, and logging.

## Key Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Backend Framework:** .NET Core  
- **Database:** SQL Server (or customizable for other relational databases)  
- **ORM:** Entity Framework Core  
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)  
- **Logging:** Integrated logging for debugging and monitoring

## Installation and Setup üîß

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)  
- A relational database (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL).  

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dogaaydinn/ProjectManagementTool.BE.git

 1.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash

    `cd ProjectManagementTool.BE`

2.  Set up the database connection string in `appsettings.json`:

    json

    `{
      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Your-Database-Connection-String-Here"
      }
    }`

3.  Apply migrations and seed the database (if applicable):

    ```bash

    `dotnet ef database update`

4.  Build and run the application:
